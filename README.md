## Representation learning for bone fractures

This experiment concentrates on the establishment of a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) model, explicitly tailored to identify body parts in X-ray images and ascertain the presence of fractures. Drawing on the evolution of deep learning and computer vision methodologies, we strive to construct a robust algorithm capable of detecting fractures and relevant body parts within X-ray images.

Semi-supervised learning, given its capacity to learn from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data, is particularly suited for medical applications where obtaining a large set of labeled data can be challenging and costly. The evolution of SSL models, such as the one presented in this report, could redefine the conventional diagnostic processes, augmenting them with improved speed, accuracy, and reliability. By investigating different proportions of labeled data for fine-tuning the model, we also explore the scalability of SSL and its performance trade-offs, an important aspect to consider when dealing with real-world medical datasets.

We present a comparative analysis with a supervised learning model, serving as a baseline. Through this comparison, we illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles in fracture detection in radiology.
